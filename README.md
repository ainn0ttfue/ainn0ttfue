## Hi there <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="28">

My name is Arthur, and I'm a Network Engineer. <br>
I'm working to build reliable and safety networks. 

I also work as a FullStack developer, using these technologies: 
- Python Django
- 1ะก Bitrix CMS

In my spare time I'm creating my own IoT devices, using ESP32 (ESP8266), relays, various sensors and other things. **You can find some repos dedicated for this stuff.**

**So, my stack is:**
- Python 3 (Django, APIs) 
- WEB (JavaScript, PHP, HTML&CSS)
- Microcontrollers (Arduino, C++, ESP8266)
- Unix based systems
- Network Engineering
- Databases (MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL)

I would be very happy to take part in an interesting project, CTF, hackathon or something like this.
